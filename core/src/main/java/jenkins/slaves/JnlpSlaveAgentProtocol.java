/**
 * {@link AgentProtocol} that accepts connection from agents.
 *
 * <h2>Security</h2>
 * <p>
 * Once connected, remote agents can send in commands to be
 * executed on the master, so in a way this is like an rsh service.
 * Therefore, it is important that we reject connections from
 * unauthorized remote agents.
 *
 * <p>
 * We do this by computing HMAC of the agent name.
 * This code is sent to the agent inside the {@code .jnlp} file
 * (this file itself is protected by HTTP form-based authentication that
 * we use everywhere else in Jenkins), and the agent sends this
 * token back when it connects to the master.
 * Unauthorized agents can't access the protected {@code .jnlp} file,
 * so it can't impersonate a valid agent.
 *
 * <p>
 * We don't want to force the inbound agents to be restarted
 * whenever the server restarts, so right now this secret master key
 * is generated once and used forever, which makes this whole scheme
 * less secure.
