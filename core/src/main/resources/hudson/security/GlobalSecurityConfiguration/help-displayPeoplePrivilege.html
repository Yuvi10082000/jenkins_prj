<p>
People page displays all the users using Jenkins, and defaults to allow any users with READ permission to access.
This configuration restricts users who can access People page.
This is useful especially not to expose users when using an external user database as Security Realm.
</p>
<p>
This configuration only controls access to People page in "All" build-in view.
People pages in other user-defined views control their display depending on permissions to projects in those views.
