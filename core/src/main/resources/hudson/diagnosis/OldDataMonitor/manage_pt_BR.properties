blurb.2=Algumas vezes ocorrem erros enquanto lendo dados (se um plugin adiciona algum dado e este plugin \u00E9 desativado posteriormente, se o c\u00F3digo de migra\u00E7\u00E3o n\u00E3o suporta mudan\u00E7as de estrutura, ou se for feito um downgrade do Jenkins ap\u00F3s ele j\u00E1 ter escrito dados n\u00E3o suportados por vers\u00F5es anteriores). Estes erros s\u00E3o registrados no log, mas os dados ileg\u00EDveis ignorados, permitindo que o Jenkins seja iniciado e funcione apropriadamente.

# The form below may be used to resave these files in the current format.  Doing so means a \
# downgrade to a Jenkins release older than the selected version will not be able to read the \
# data stored in the new format.  Note that simply using Jenkins to create and configure jobs \
# and run builds can save data that may not be readable by older Jenkins releases, even when \
# this form is not used.  Also if any unreadable data errors are reported in the right side \
# of the table above, note that this data will be lost when the file is resaved.

It is ok to leave unreadable data in these items/records, as Jenkins will simply ignore it. \
To avoid the log messages at Jenkins startup you can permanently delete the unreadable data \
by resaving these items/records using the button below the list.
blurb.3=---TranslateMe 334--- \
The form below may be used to update these items/records to the current format.  Doing so means a \
downgrade to a Jenkins release or plugin older than the selected version will not be able to \
read the data stored in the new format.  Note that simply using Jenkins to create and \
configure jobs and run builds can save data that may not be readable by older Jenkins or \
plugin versions, even when this form is not used.  Also if any unreadable data errors are \
reported in the right side of the table above, note that this data will be lost when the \
item is resaved.
blurb.5=---TranslateMe 335--- \
(downgrade as far back as the selected version may still be possible)
blurb.4=---TranslateMe 336--- \
Eventually the code supporting these data migrations may be removed.  Compatibility will be \
retained for at least 150 Jenkins releases after the structure change.  Versions older than \
this are listed above in bold, and it is recommended you resave these items/records.
blurb.1=---TranslateMe 337--- \
When there are changes in how data is stored on disk, Jenkins uses the following strategy: \
data is migrated to the new structure when it is loaded, but items/records are not resaved in \
the new format.  This allows for downgrading Jenkins if necessary.  However, it can also leave \
data on disk in the old format indefinitely.  The table below lists items/records containing \
such data, and the Jenkins version(s) where the data structure was changed.
