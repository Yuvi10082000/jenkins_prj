    With this option checked, Hudson will not do a checkout from the SCM system 
    for each configuration.
    This can be usefull if your configuration can build concurrent from the same 
    master source (e.g. via NFS/SMB), and it saves the time of the SCM-checkout.<br />
    NB: The feature currently only works if a job is constranied to one node with
    several executors, otherwise an exception will be thrown and the build will fail.
