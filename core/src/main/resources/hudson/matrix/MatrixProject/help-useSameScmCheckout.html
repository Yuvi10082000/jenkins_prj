    With this option checked, Jenkins will not do a checkout from the SCM system 
    for each configuration.
    This can be usefull if your configuration can build concurrent from the same 
    master source (e.g. via network share or when all builds run on the same node), 
    and it saves the time, bandwith and disk space of the SCM-checkout.
