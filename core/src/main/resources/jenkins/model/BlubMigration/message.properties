blurb = The term "master" for the main process of Jenkins and built-in node is being retired. \
  The main process is now called "controller" and the built-in node is called "blub". \
  The latter change also changes the name-derived label assigned to that node (<code>master</code> to <code>blub</code>) and the <code>NODE_NAME</code> \
  environment variable passed to builds running on that node. \
  Depending on your configuration, this is a potentially breaking change. \
  Review your job configurations for node assignments and build scripts for use of the <code>NODE_NAME</code> environment variable before applying this change.
