blurb = Builds in Jenkins run as the internal <span style="font-family: monospace;">SYSTEM</span> user with full permissions by default. \
  This can be a problem if some users have restricted or no access to some jobs, but can configure others. \
  If that is the case, it is recommended to install a plugin implementing build authentication, and to override this default.

queueItemAuthenticatorPresent = \u2705 An implementation of access control for builds is present.
noQueueItemAuthenticatorPresent = \u274c No implementation of access control for builds is present. \
  It is recommended that you install <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/authorize-project" target="_blank">Authorize Project Plugin</a> or another plugin \
  implementing the <a href="https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/extensions/jenkins-core/#queueitemauthenticator" target="_blank">QueueItemAuthenticator</a> \
  extension point.

queueItemAuthenticatorConfigured = \u2705 Access control for builds is configured.
noQueueItemAuthenticatorConfigured = \u274c Access control for builds is possible, but not configured. Configure it in the <a href="{0}/configureSecurity">global security configuration</a>.

anyBuildLaunchedAsSystem = \u274c Builds have been observed as launching as the internal <span style="font-family: monospace;">SYSTEM</span> user despite access control for builds being set up. \
  See <a href="{1}">the list of launched builds</a> for details. \
  It is recommended that you <a href="{0}/configureSecurity">review the access control for builds configuration</a> to ensure builds are not generally running as the <span style="font-family: monospace;">SYSTEM</span> user.
