    When checked (the default), Jenkins will reset environment variables defined outside Jenkins to the original value passed on to the Jenkins process.

<p>
    When unchecked, Jenkins will remove those environment variables from this build step's environment.
    These are typically system environment variables like <code>HOME</code>, <code>LANG</code>, and <code>PATH</code>, and some of them will be required for the correct execution of programs.
    When this option is unchecked, necessary environment variables need to be explicitly listed above to be retained.
