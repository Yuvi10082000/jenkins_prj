  <p>
  If build requires access to desktop (for example to run some u.i. swing tests, etc) this option must be checked.
  If not, Jenkins will run the build process headless.
  <p>
  For backward compatibility, this option is enabled by default for jobs that have been created before it was introduced
  in jenkins.
