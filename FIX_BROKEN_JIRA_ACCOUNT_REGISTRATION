Jenkins Jira, Wiki and Fisheye use a common authentication system:

	https://jenkins-ci.org/account/

This purports to allow users to sign up.

Currently, the sign-up process is broken.  When completing the form
successfully, I receive an email with the following content:

  +----
  |  	Unassigned created for you a JIRA account
  |  
  | Jenkins JIRA
  | 
  | JIRA is the project tracker for teams building great software. Log
  | in now to track your issues and tasks, collaborate with your team,
  | and stay on top of project activity.
  | 
  | Username: 	<User ID>
  | Email: 	<E-mail>
  | Full Name: 	<First Name> <Last Name>
  | 
  | This account uses your password from an external user directory:
  | "{0}".
  +----

(where <User ID>, <E-mail>, <First Name> and <Last Name> are the
values entered when registering)

However, at this point I have no password, so cannot sign-in.

When I complete the "Reset the password" page:

	  https://jenkins-ci.org/account/passwordReset

The page claims to send me an email with the new email.  However, I
received no such email.

I cannot report this problem because one needs a working Jira account
to report any problems.
