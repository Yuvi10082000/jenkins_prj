= Documentation for core maintainers

toc::[]

Jenkins core is a central component of the project which serves millions of users, and it is critical to maintain it in a good shape.
We want to ensure quality of the integrated changes and continuity of the project,
and hence the Jenkins core pull request review and merge process is more sophisticated than for the majority of plugins.

== Scope of the document

This document applies to the following components:

* Jenkins core
* Jenkins modules
* Libraries included into the Jenkins core
* Core components like Winstone, Executable WAR, etc.

Jenkins Remoting library is not in the scope for this document,
because it is handled as a sub-project with independent maintainer team.
Remoting updates in the core are subject to the process though.

== Team

=== Communication channels

* link:https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-dev[Jenkins Developer Mailing List]
* Chat: N/A, to be created
* Office hours: N/A, to be created

=== Roles

* Contributor
* Core Pull Request Reviewer
* Core Maintainer
* Release Team Member

**Contributors** submit pull requests to the Jenkins core and review changes submitted by others.
They can also review and triage incoming issues in Jenkins Jira.
There is no special preconditions to do so, anyone is welcome to contribute.

**Core Pull Request Reviewers** is the next step for contributors who are interested to review Jenkins pull requests on a regular basis.
They get https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization[Triage permissions] so that they can manage pull requests, request reviews and prepare changelog drafts in the pull request description.
Their main responsibility is to triage and review the incoming pull requests,
and to guide newcomer contributors who are not familiar with the project's processes.
GitHub team: link:https://github.com/orgs/jenkinsci/teams/core-pr-reviewers[@jenkinsci/core-pr-reviewers].

**Core Maintainers** get `Write` permissions in the repository, and hence they are able to merge pull requests.
Their responsibility is to perform pull request reviews on a regular basis and to merge ready pull requests towards the weekly releases (`master` branch).
They are also responsible to monitor the weekly release status and to perform triage of critical issues.
GitHub team: link:https://github.com/orgs/jenkinsci/teams/core[@jenkinsci/core].

**Release Team Members** are responsible for Jenkins weekly and LTS releases.
Led by the link:https://jenkins.io/project/team-leads/#release[Jenkins Release Officer], they initiate releases, prepare changelogs and backport changes into the link:TODO[Stable branch].
Team members get `Write` permissions in the Jenkins core repository, and they also get permissions to trigger release Pipelines.

=== Ladder

* **Contributors**. Anyone can participate.
  There is no precondition except having a GitHub account, just submit pull requests or comment in existing ones!
* **Core Pull Request Reviewers** can be nominated by contributors in the link:https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-dev[developer mailing list]. 
Self-nomination is fine.
Decision is made by a consensus in the mailing list or via voting at the link:https://jenkins.io/project/governance-meeting/[governance meeting].
* **Core Maintainers** - same process as for Core PR reviewers.
  All nominees must also sign an link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/infra-cla/[Individual Contributor License Agreement] before getting the permission in GitHub repositories.
* **Release Team Members** are assigned by the Jenkins Release officer

== Pull request review process

Jenkins core is a mission-critical part of the ecosystem.
We need to ensure that submitted pull requests are not only code complete,
but also that they do not introduce undesired defects, breaking changes and technical debt.
At the same time, we are interested to make the review process as simple as possible for contributors and maintainers.

=== Code review goals

There are the following code review goals:

* Ensure that the pull request is _feasible_ and that it fits the Jenkins ecosystem
* Verify _compatibility_ of the suggested changes
* Ensure that the pull request matches the _code quality_ practices: test automation, Javadoc for newly introduced APIs, etc.
* Ensure that the pull request contains appropriate changelogs and, if needed, upgrade guidelines.
* Ensure there is a _consensus_ among reviewers about all items above.

**Feasibility**.
Reviewers are expected to look at changes critically from a "product management" point of view.
It's not just about the code, but also whether the change makes sense in a global / holistic way, considering existing popular plugins and the way users experience Jenkins overall.
Also, not every change needs to be merged into the core.
Many features would be better introduced as plugins which have separate release cycles and allow delivering changes faster.
We want to extend the Jenkins core and incorporate widely used functionality and extension points there,
but we try to keep the core as minimal as possible in terms of dependencies.

**Compatibility**.
The Jenkins project has a long history of backward compatibility.
We accept breaking changes when it is needed (security fixes, feature deprecation and removal, etc.),
but ultimately the project's goal is retain as much compatibility as possible.
It includes both feature compatibility and binary/API compatibility which is important for the plugin ecosystem.
Although we have some tools (like https://github.com/jenkins-infra/usage-in-plugins[usage-in-plugins]) for checking API usages across open-source plugins,
there is no way to confirm external usages in 3rd-party proprietary plugins which is also a part of the ecosystem.

**Code quality**.
The code doesn't have to be perfect, but we want to ensure that all new code matches basic quality standards:
test coverage for newly added functionality and fixes,
documentation for newly introduced APIs,
the submitted code is readable and matches the code style in the surrounding codebase,
etc.

**Consensus**.
Not all changes are discussed before they submitted as pull requests.
Developer mailing lists, Jira issues and JEPs are used for discussions,
but sometimes the changes go straight to the pull requests.
And we are fine with that, especially for small patches.
Pull requests often become a venue to discuss feasibility, underlying technical decisions and design.
We are fine with that as well.
If there is no consensus about the feasibility and implementation,
code reviewers are expected to suggest proper channels for contributors to discuss their contribution.

* A discussion in the link:https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-dev[Jenkins Developer Mailing List] is the default way to go
* If no consensus can be reached on the mailing list,
  voting at the link:https://jenkins.io/project/governance-meeting/[Jenkins Governance Meeting] can be used to get a final decision.

=== Code review non-goals

Code reviews do NOT pursue the following goals:

* Accepting/merging any pull request. 
  Not everything is going to be merged, and reviewers are expected to focus on the Jenkins ecosystem integrity first.
  We guide contributors and help them to get their changes integrated, but it needs cooperation on both sides.
  It is **fine** to close invalid and inactive pull requests if there is no activity by a submitter or other contributors.
* Enforcing a particular coding style.
  Jenkins core has a complex codebase created by many contributors, and different files have different designs.
  Our main goal is to firstly have the code readable by other contributors.
* Make contributors to fix unrelated issues
** Create follow-up issues instead, it is fine to reference them in comments so that the contributor might want to pick them up
* Breakdown the commit history or squashing PRs
** Not every contributor is a Git expert, do not request changes in the commit history unless it is necessary
** Core maintainers can squash PRs during the merge.
   If you feel this is important, add the `squash-merge-me` label
** We want to keep pull requests focused when possible (one feature / fix per pull request),
   but we can live without it if there is no need to backport changes to the stable baseline.

== Merge process

=== Common merge process

**Step 1: Maintainer checklist**. Merge process can be initiated once a pull request matches the requirements:

* Pull request is compliant with requirements to submitters (see the link:/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md[pull request template])
* There are at least 2 approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change
* Conversations in the pull request are over OR it is explicit that a reviewer does not block the change (often indicated by line comments attached to an approving PR review, or by using the term "nit", from "nit-picking")
* Changelog entries in the PR title and/or _Proposed changelog entries_ are correct and reflect the current, final state of the PR
* Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically
* If the change needs administrators to be aware of it when upgrading, the `upgrade-guide-needed` label is present. This is usually the case when a data migration occurs, a feature has been removed, a significant behavior change is introduced (including when there is a way to opt out), or in general when we expect at least a large minority of admins to benefit from knowing about the change, e.g. to apply a new option.
  and there is a `Proposed upgrade guidelines` section in the PR title.
  (link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4387[example])
* It would make sense to backport the change to LTS, a Jira issue should exist and be labeled as `lts-candidate`

**Step 2: Marking for merge**. Once the checklist is passed,
a Core PR Reviewer or a Maintainer can mark the pull request for merge.

* `ready-for-merge` label is set
* An explicit comment is added to the pull request so that other repository watchers are notified.
  Example: _Thanks to all contributors! We consider this change as ready to be merged towards the next weekly release. It may be merged after 24hours if there is no negative feedback_

**Step 3: Merge!**
A Core Maintainer merges the change after allowing sufficient time for comment (if needed).
After that the change will be landed in the next weekly release.
LTS Backporting, if needed, will be handled separately by the release team.

=== Exceptions

* Jenkins Security Team uses a different process for security issue fixes.
  They are reviewed and integrated by the Security team in private repositories.
  Security hardening and enhancements go through the standard process.
* Release Team members are permitted to bypass the review/merge process if and only if a change is needed to unblock the security release.
  Common review process is used otherwise.
* 24 hours waiting period after adding the `ready-for-merge` label is not required for:
//TODO(oleg_nenashev): Define "trivial" better to avoid loopholes
** trivial changes like typo fixes or minor Javadoc improvements
** changes which do not affect the production code: Jenkinsfile tweaks, tools inside the repo, etc. 
** broken master build

=== Squashing pull requests OR not?

Right now we do not have a strict policy about it.
