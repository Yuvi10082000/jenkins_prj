  Use a touchstone if you want to run a sanity check before building the remaining combinations.
  A touchstone can be defined using a combination filter. All builds matching this filter
  will be executed first. If the result satisfies the result condition, the remaining
  active combinations are built.<p />
  You can also define multiple touchstones by specifying several semicolon separated touchstones.
  This might be helpful when you have multiple steps for multiple platforms, and you want to
  make sure that all platforms take step n before occupying your infrastructure with step n+1.<p />

  Example:<p />
  Label expression PLATFORM = "win32 linuxX86"<br>
  Label expression STEP = "build unit_test feature_test deploy"<p />
  hgTouchstone = STEP="win32"; STEP="unit_test"; STEP="feature_test"<br>

  Unit tests will only be started for any platform if the build was successful
  for all platforms. Likewise for feature tests depending on successful unit
  tests for all platforms, deployment depending on successful feature tests for
  all platforms.
